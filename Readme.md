An assembler optimisation game!

Each level has some assembler code which runs in a loop.
There is a target for the number of stalls in the loop, and a maximum number of
stalls before you 'lose' that level. 

You can move each instruction around, but be careful not to break the code,
or move an instruction past where the processor is reading at the time!


Todo:

 * Automatically generate instruction dependencies for the level.
 * More explanation
